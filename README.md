# CPSC 304 Project: Group 19

Back-end files and starting scripts adapted from the JavaScript demo project

Some features that we planned on adding based on the ER Diagram (leaving reviews, showing content availability by streaming service) were left out do to time constraints. These may be needed to have some of the features (such as ultimate reviewers) fully usable in a real environment, but the data provided by the script is enough to demonstrate these queries.
